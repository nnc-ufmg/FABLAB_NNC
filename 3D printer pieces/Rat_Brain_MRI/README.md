The image acquisition was performed by Flavio Mourao in 01/2017<br />
Magnet Resonance Center of Technology (CTPMAG/UFMG)<br />
Neuroscience Research Center (NNC)<br />
Federal University of Minas Gerais -  Brazil<br />

Aquisition:<br />
4.7 NMR System (Oxford Systems) controlled by UNITY Inova-200 imaging console (Varian). <br />
The scanner protocol was defined by 2-weighted (TR = 3000 ms, TE = 50 ms) spin echo multi-coronal slice scans  with of 1 mm thickness covering the entire brain. The images were obtained with resolution of 256 × 128 voxels in a slice of 3.2 × 3.2 cm.<br />
